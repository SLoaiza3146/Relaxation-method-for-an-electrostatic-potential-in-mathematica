# Electrostatic Potential Calculation Using Iterative Relaxation Method

## Overview
This repository contains a Mathematica program based on the iterative relaxation method to solve for the electrostatic potential in a two-dimensional finite "volume" with boundary conditions and "conductors" at specified potentials. The program also computes the electric field using numerical derivatives within Mathematica.

## Contents
- **Mathematica Notebook**: Implementation of the relaxation method for calculating electrostatic potentials and electric fields.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation explaining the analytical and numerical methods applied to a specific case within the Mathematica environment.

## Features
- **Electrostatic Potential Calculation**: The program uses an iterative approach to model the potential distribution in a predefined area.
- **Electric Field Computation**: Numerical derivatives are calculated in Mathematica to determine the electric field from the potential gradients.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes thorough explanations of the theoretical foundations, computational procedures, and interpretation of results.

## Getting Started
